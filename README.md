# YourTravel

Welcome to my second website!

This website was build as a **development milestone project** for the completion of the Interactive Frontend Development module and it's part of the learning material for Code Institute's Fullstack Web Developer program.

A live **desktop demo** can be found [here](https://gaspar91.github.io/mlsp2/).

The **source code** for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/gaspar91/mlsp2).

# UX

This website was build as a source of turism in Oslo in order to help travellers and locals to enjoy what the city has to offer.

The website offers users the opportunity to discover the city though their services with a map which provides useful points of interest such as accomodation, restaurants, parks, activities, bars and coffee shops, and a gallery with photos from the city to motivate the users to travel.


# Design Process XXXXXX

You'll be able to view the sketches, wireframes, and mockups for this project in the **Wireframes** folder, located within the **Static** folder in the  [Github project repository](https://github.com/gaspar91/mlsp2).

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to build the wireframes, so you might need the program in order to view some of the documents.
