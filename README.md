# YourTravel

Welcome to my second website!

This website was build as a **development milestone project** for the completion of the Interactive Frontend Development module and it's part of the learning material for Code Institute's Fullstack Web Developer program.

A live **desktop demo** can be found [here](https://gaspar91.github.io/mlsp2/).

The **source code** for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/gaspar91/mlsp2).

# UX

This website was build as a source of turism in Oslo in order to help travellers and locals to enjoy what the city has to offer.

The website offers users the opportunity to discover the city though their services with a map which provides useful points of interest such as accomodation, restaurants, parks, activities, bars and coffee shops, and a gallery with photos from the city to motivate the users to travel.


# Design Process XXXXXX

You'll be able to view the sketches, wireframes, and mockups for this project in the **Wireframes** folder, located within the **Static** folder in the  [Github project repository](https://github.com/gaspar91/mlsp2).

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to build the wireframes, so you might need the program in order to view some of the documents.


# User Stories

### User Story One:

As a person visiting a new place I would like to know witch are the most recommended places to visit and the best accomodations to stay.

### User Story Two:

It's important to me that there are several places to visit to keep me entertained and have a fun experience.

### User Story Three:

It's important to me to see what the city looks like and I would like to see that through social media, with images and other people's comments.

### User Story Three:

Accessibility is fundamental for me, so if I can search for the website when I'm walking or I'm far away from my computer I can just search for it on my phone or tablet.

### User Story Four:

As someone who doesn't like to waist time with giving to much detail, filling up a short and quick form, in order to get more information is really nice and motivates me to do it.

### User Story Five:

It is also important that there is a confirmation of my submission.
